Project Summary:

This project involved an in-depth analysis of crime data in Chicago, with a focus on data exploration, visualization, classification modeling, and clustering. 
The primary goal was to gain insights into crime patterns and develop predictive and clustering models to better understand and address crime-related challenges in the city.

Key Tasks and Findings:

Dataset Overview:
The project began with an overview of the dataset, understanding its structure and contents.

Crime Prevalence:
Identified the most prevalent types of crimes in Chicago.

Top 10 Crimes Percentage:
Analyzed the top 10 crimes based on their percentage of occurrence.

Domestic vs. Non-Domestic Crimes:
Investigated the distribution of domestic and non-domestic crimes in the dataset.

Description of Crimes with Crime Type:
Provided a detailed description of crimes along with their crime types.

Year with the Most Crime:
Determined which year had the highest overall crime rate.

Percentage of Successful Arrests:
Calculated the percentage of successful arrests from the dataset.

Successful Arrests Yearly:
Examined the yearly trend of successful arrests.

Crimes by District (2001 - 2018):
Analyzed crime occurrences based on districts over the years.

High-Crime Locations:
Identified locations where crimes were most prevalent.

Geographical Crime Rate:
Explored the geographical distribution of crime rates in Chicago.

Machine Learning Models:
Imported the scikit-learn library and performed data preprocessing.
Applied classification models, including RandomForest Classification and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Best Performing Model:
Determined that the KNN algorithm delivered the best performance among the classification models.


Tools and Environment:

The project was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization were essential steps to gain insights into the dataset.
Classification models, including RandomForest and KNN, were implemented to predict crime occurrences.
Clustering was performed using the k-Means algorithm to group similar crime patterns.
This project provided valuable insights into Chicago's crime landscape and developed predictive models to assist law enforcement and
policymakers in making informed decisions. 
The KNN algorithm was identified as the most suitable for predicting crime occurrences.
Additionally, the geographical analysis shed light on areas with higher crime rates, 

contributing to better resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.
